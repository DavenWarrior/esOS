# esOS
Extremely Simple Operating System    .....     Don't expect anything great.

Currently, nothing more than a bootloader .. or the starts of one anyway. I am currently testing it in a Virtual Setting.
Kernel and OS work in C should begin soon.

USE:
Bootloader is compiled by going to */tools* and choosing location to build bootloader on. Note, if you wamt to actually use it, 
you should change the paths in those utilities in the */tools* folder.
